0. What's stdint.h? - Stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing 
a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.

1. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program? - It's an unsigned types for  BYTE, DWORD, LONG and  WORD

2. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? - 1, 4, 4, 2.

3. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
This value saved in bfType.
Two first bytes contains - 0x424d

4. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize? 
    bfType - contain 2 bytes. it's a header value of BMP file. 
    bfSize - caontain 4 bytes. Size in BYTES of the file.

5. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
Figure collapses in the upper left corner.

6. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    28 WORD bibitCount.
    
7. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    If there is file missing or reading error.

8. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    The number of elements, each of which has a size of byte. We are always using 1 structure.
    
9. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
 3 pixels * 3 bytes * 3 padding = 12, that is multiple by 4.
 
10. What does fseek do?
fseek function moves the pointer to the position in the stream.
Sets the internal pointer of the position in the file to a new position, which is determined by adding an offset to the starting position.

11. What is SEEK_CUR?
One parameter of the fseek function.
The current position of the file.
