0. Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is an English word that refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis. 
It is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary.

1.  It is a benchmark for gathering statistics, especially execute time.

2. It is contains 16 variables.

3. Every time we calling this variables (before and after), value of this variables is always overwritten. 
So for every new benchmark our variables in struck have to be initialized.
Due to it performance of the code is lower. 

4.  The "for" loop iterates through the whole file, character by character, until the EOF is reached.
If the current character is alphabetic or "\'" (apostrophe) its appends the character to the word. The index counter is incremented.
The index and the character has a bond. 
It is necessary for the implementation of the verification algorithm with a dictionary.
If the index is higher than the maximum length of a word, we read through the rest of the word and dont add it to the array.
The index is equals 0 in that case.
If the character is digit it is ignored. 
The index is reseted (=0) and ready for a new word.
When we found the word, we separate it by the "\0" and checking the word spelling also calling the benchmark for before and after conditions. 
If the word is misspelled - print it.
The index is reseted for the next word by equating it to zero.

5. Due to using the fgetc() function we are able to make an easy verifying for digits, non-alphabetical characters etc.
The fscanf() function return the string that should contail the whole list of entered words. It not rational in terms of resources.

6. For variable immutability.
